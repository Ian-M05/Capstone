Transcript directions from meeting:
"""Here is the transcript thats important:
More about each other, and then maybe brainstorm the, the user authentication piece on this application.
we'll have a user table, where we'll have a first name, last name, and a user ID.
We will design the authentication this way.
And I think that'll be a huge win. If you next week, you come in, and you have a symbol.
